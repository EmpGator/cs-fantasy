swiss stage result table sort only works for points, not scores
show some sort of result summary in landing page
tournament creation wizard fails to create bracket matches

Workflow concept:

- admin creates a tournament, complete with all modules needed (this should be easier)
- users go to site, register/login and join opens tournament page that accepts predictions
- after module has concluded, fetch results, map them internally and calculate scores
- modules belonging to next stage, should be updated with correct data
- go back to stage 2 and repeat until no more stages/modules left
